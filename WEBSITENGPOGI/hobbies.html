 <p h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;font-family:arial;" align="center">I love painting, though i am not perfectly good at it. i find it really
    intriguing and fun on depicting a philosophy or advices through
    art.

 <p h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;font-family:arial;" align="center">Not a day goes by without me 
    singing or humming some melodies. again, i am not perfectly good at it but i am more than happy

 <h1 align="center">DANCING</h1>
 <p h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;font-family:arial;" align="center">In my junior years, i really liked dancing 
    but because i've gained some weight and i'm way more stress now than before and my skill and determination on dancing
    isn't good or enough either. but now, i'm loving it again because i'm starting to gain confidence.

    <h1 align="center">SPORTS</h1>
 <p h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;font-family:arial;" align="center">I was really athletic before, i loved different 
   kinds of sports but because i am really lazy lately and stressed i can't focus on it. but for sure, on my free time such as vacations 
   i will really start playing again.

    <h1 align="center">GAMING</h1>
    <p h2 style="font-size:20px;color:black;font-family:arial;" align="center">This is what i'm doing right now aside from 
        school, i use my free time on playing games/video games that can satisfy my brain to ease up the stress that 
        i am feeling though sometimes it is some sort of a stress too.
